Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

A rough code of the minesweeper game. Currently not coded an event for losing, but mines are randomly added depending on your settings and you can somewhat determine where mines are as clicked tiles show number of surrounding mines.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to code a loss event for when clicking a mine and the option to flag a tile as a mine. I also plan to add some unique abilities to help you clear the game, but not too sure if I can do that yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The main problem was figuring out how the algorithm to the game. Creating the code for the tiles that would state how many mines are around I found to be the most difficult
